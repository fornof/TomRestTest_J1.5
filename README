This is a com.sun.jersey 1.15 answer to use @RolesAllowed() security annotations. 

## TESTING

:: please change this when using curl - your ports are probably different

::curl -u robert:robert -basic http://localhost:8079/J1SecurityAnnotations/rest/hello/admin
curl -u admin:adminadmin -basic http://localhost:8079/J1SecurityAnnotations/rest/hello/admin

curl -u admin2:admin -basic http://localhost:8079/J1SecurityAnnotations/rest/hello/admin

conf/tomcat-users.xml should include the users "robert" and "admin" as well as the roles "robert" and "admin"
